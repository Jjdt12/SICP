**Exercise 1.5:** Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

**ANSWER**

```
With applictive-order evaluation Ben will observe that the process 
repeats infinietly because (p) infinitely expands itself during evalutation. 

(test 0 (p))

(if (= x 0) 0 (p))

(p) is evaluated before applying resulting procedures so:

(p) is (p) is (p) is (p)...etc.

With normal-order evaluation Ben will observe that the interpreter does output 
a result, 0. This is because in normal-order evaluation operands are not evaluated
until their values are needed:

 (test 0 (p)) 
  
 (p) is then subsituted before evaluation, and is not evaulated until/if it needed:

 (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) 
  
 (if TRUE 0 (p)) 

 Since 0 = 0 evaluations to TRUE, then (p) is not evaluated. 
  
 Output: 0
```
