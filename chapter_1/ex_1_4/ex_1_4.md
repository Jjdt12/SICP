**Exercise 1.4:** Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

**ANSWER**

```
If b is greater then zero, set a and b
Else subtract b from a. 
```
